# Smart Biomarker Adjust

This project was initially developed in under 24 hours during a hackathon, where I personally handled both the backend (Node.js) and frontend (React). The project is still a work in progress and is set to evolve into a fully reusable and scalable system that can integrate with real-world devices like wearable sensors (e.g., smartwatches), allowing for seamless data collection and real-time analysis.

## Overview

Smart Biomarker Adjust is designed to streamline the implementation of smart treatments for chronic diseases like asthma, where real-time monitoring can be life-saving. The system receives health data from sensors, processes it, and delivers immediate feedback to both users and healthcare providers. The key goal is to make it faster and easier for companies or developers to integrate health monitoring solutions, whether they already have sensor systems or not.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Health Monitoring**: Integrate with sensors (e.g., smartwatches) to collect data in real time, analyze it, and alert users if something is abnormal.
- **Scalable and Reusable Architecture**: The system is designed to be easily adaptable, so developers can modify it to fit specific needs or deploy it quickly in different healthcare scenarios.
- **Backend-Frontend Synergy**: Built with a Node.js backend and a React frontend for smooth communication between data sources (sensors, APIs) and the user interface.
- **Data Flexibility**: Works with sensor data or API-based health data, making it adaptable for different systems.

## Use Case Example

For patients with asthma, this system can:
1. **Data Collection**: A smartwatch collects real-time data on vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and other important biomarkers.
2. **Data Transmission**: The data is sent to the web app via the backend, where it is analyzed.
3. **User Alert**: If any abnormal patterns are detected, the user is alerted instantly via notifications on the web app.
4. **Custom Integration**: Companies with existing sensor systems can easily plug them into this system to implement smart disease management solutions, reducing implementation time and cost.

## Long-Term Vision

The goal is to build a system that:
- Makes the development and deployment of smart treatment solutions faster and less expensive.
- Allows healthcare providers and tech companies to focus on customizing the system to their needs rather than building everything from scratch.
- Facilitates early intervention and prevention through continuous health monitoring, improving patient outcomes.
  
Whether you're a startup with no sensor infrastructure or a company with a fully built-out system, Smart Biomarker Adjust provides the tools to rapidly implement an advanced monitoring solution.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with additional data sources and health monitoring devices.
- AI-driven health analytics for more accurate predictions and alerts.
- More modular architecture to support a wider range of diseases and conditions.
- User authentication, data security, and privacy enhancements.
